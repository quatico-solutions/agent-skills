## Status

- **Phase:** Draft
- **Type:** feature | bug | docs | infra
- **Story:** <!-- optional, story slug (docs/stories/<slug>/) — the durable intent this plan serves -->
- **Sprint:** <!-- optional, filled when plan is added to a sprint — a time-boxed selection of planned work -->
- **Review:** <!-- pr | in-session | ballot — how is this plan reviewed & approved? -->
- **Impl:** <!-- own branches | same branch | other repo | none — where does implementation happen? -->
<!-- Transition records — written by the workflow commands, not by hand:
- **Approved:** <date>, <who>, <channel>
- **Started:** <date>, <who>, <branch>   (one line per started branch)

## Changelog

<!-- Release note entry. Written during planning, refined during implementation. -->

- <user-facing change description>

## Motivation

<!-- Why does this matter? What problem does it solve? -->

## Design

### Approach

<!-- How will this be implemented? Key architectural decisions. -->

### Open Points

- [ ] ...

## Branches

<!-- Optional: define a tracer bullet (thin vertical slice) first. -->
<!-- See the tracer-bullets skill for guidance. -->
<!-- ### Tracer -->
<!-- - `feature/<slug>-tracer` — <thin slice description> -->
<!--   Layers: <layer> → <layer> → <layer> -->
<!--   Proves: <what this validates> -->
<!--   Status: Not started -->

<!-- When using ### Tracer, wrap remaining branches in ### Implementation: -->
<!-- ### Implementation -->

<!-- Waves: branches under one ### subheading may run concurrently. A wave is
     eligible once every non-deferred branch in every PRIOR wave is merged, so
     `### Tracer` proves the seam before `### Implementation` fans out. Add
     `### Wave 3`, `### Wave 4`, … for anything that must follow.
     No subheadings at all = one wave = every branch eligible at once (the
     pre-wave behaviour). Check state with /plot-fleet.
     Annotations (deferred:/claimed:/moved:) must sit on the SAME line as
     the backticked branch name — a wrapped continuation line is not read. -->

- `feature/<slug>` — <description>

## Definition of Done

<!-- Per ## Plot Config in CLAUDE.md. Check before marking any impl PR ready. -->

- [ ] `pnpm test` passes — skills parse
- [ ] `pnpm run validate` passes — skill frontmatter valid
- [ ] `bb` suite green on Linux **and** macOS/bash 3.2 — only if the diff touches `bin/bb`
- [ ] Changeset added with a `bumps:` block, and `tuned-against:` where the change is model-specific
- [ ] `README.md` skills table matches `skills/` — required when adding or removing a skill
