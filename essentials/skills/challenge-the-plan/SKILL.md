# Challenge the Plan

> **Reads an implementation plan and interviews you systematically across all dimensions to uncover gaps, validate assumptions, and refine decisions.**

## Input

**$ARGUMENTS**: `./path/to/PLAN.md` (optional)

1. If `$ARGUMENTS` provides a file path, read that file as the plan
2. If empty, search the current working directory for files matching:
   - `PLAN.md`, `PLAN-*.md`, `*-PLAN.md`
   - `SPEC.md`, `SPEC-*.md`, `*-SPEC.md`
   - `STORY.md`, `STORY-*.md`, `*-STORY.md`
3. If no match in cwd, auto-detect the most recent plan file in:
   - `~/.claude/plans/` (Claude Code)
   - `./.cursor/plans/` (Cursor)
4. If nothing detected, ask the user which file to challenge — do NOT proceed without a confirmed plan file

## Execution Workflow

### Phase 1: Plan Discovery

1. Resolve plan file (from argument or auto-detect)
2. Read plan content
3. Parse structure to identify sections, decisions, and assumptions
4. Check for an existing "Open Questions" section (indicates a previous session)

### Phase 2: Initial Analysis (first run only)

Scan plan for:
- Implicit assumptions (words like "will", "should", "could" without justification)
- Technical decisions lacking rationale
- Business logic without domain validation
- UX flows missing edge case handling
- Non-functional risks (security, performance, scalability)

### Phase 3: Question Generation (4 per round)

Generate 4 questions focused on a single category or cross-cutting theme:

**Technical (Stack -> Architecture -> Implementation)**
- Stack: Why this framework/library? What are alternatives?
- Architecture: How do components communicate? Where does logic live?
- Implementation: Error handling? Edge cases? Rollback strategy?

**Domain (Business Rules & Workflows)**
- What defines valid entities and constraints?
- Who can perform operations? Authorization rules?
- Complete entity lifecycle?
- Workflow triggers and state management?

**UX (Happy -> Edge -> Error -> Accessibility)**
- Happy path: User journey when everything works
- Edge cases: Rapid clicks, unusual input, navigation away
- Error states: Error messages, recovery, debugging
- Accessibility: Screen readers, keyboard nav, color contrast

**Non-Functional (Hypothesis-Driven)**
- Security: Input sanitization, authorization, credential storage
- Performance: Response times, query optimization, indexing
- Scalability: Traffic spikes, rate limits, horizontal scaling

**Trade-offs**
- What alternatives were considered? Why rejected?
- What's the downside of the chosen solution?
- What would trigger reconsidering this decision?

**Question Complexity Assessment:**
- **Complex** (include "I don't know / leave for team" option):
  - Questions requiring domain expertise
  - Questions with significant trade-offs
  - Questions about future concerns
  - Questions about non-obvious edge cases
- **Simple** (no deferral needed):
  - Yes/No validations
  - Confirming stated facts
  - Choosing from clear alternatives
  - Obvious constraints

**Tone Adaptation:**
- **Neutral**: Information gathering (happy path flows)
- **Skeptical**: Challenging assumptions (security, edge cases)
- **Socratic**: Complex trade-offs (architecture decisions)

**Audience Adaptation:**
- **Technical phrasing**: Implementation details, code organization
- **Business phrasing**: Requirements, user needs, domain rules

### Phase 4: Interview Execution

Use the structured question tool to present 4 questions per round:
- Claude Code: `AskUserQuestion` tool
- Cursor: `ask_question` tool

**Question format:**
1. Each question gets 2-4 concrete choices (A/B/C/D)
2. Complex questions include: "I don't know / leave as open question for the team"
3. "Other" option is automatically provided by the tool for free-form text
4. Track question history to prevent redundancy

**Deferral options** (for complex questions):
- "I don't know"
- "Let's discuss with the team"
- "Leave question for [name]" (e.g., "Leave question for a colleague")

Collect deferred responses for the Open Questions section.

### Phase 5: Plan Refinement

**Narrative Weaving Principles:**
1. **No meta-commentary**: Don't add "Validated:" or "Interview finding:" markers
2. **Natural integration**: Expand existing sections with details as if always there
3. **Maintain voice**: Keep plan's original writing style and tone
4. **Add detail, not sections**: Enrich existing content rather than appending

**Example Transformation:**

Before:
```
## Authentication
We'll use JWT tokens for authentication. Users log in and receive a token.
```

After:
```
## Authentication
We'll use JWT tokens for authentication with a 15-minute access token expiry and 7-day refresh token. Users authenticate via email/password, receiving both tokens stored in httpOnly cookies to prevent XSS attacks. When multiple tabs are open, token refresh is coordinated via BroadcastChannel API to avoid race conditions. If a user's session expires mid-form-fill, we preserve form state in sessionStorage and restore after re-authentication via a modal overlay (no redirect, preventing data loss).

The alternative of session-based auth was rejected due to horizontal scaling requirements—JWT allows stateless authentication across multiple API servers without session store synchronization overhead.
```

Update the original plan file with refined content.

### Phase 6: Completion Check

Exit when:
1. User explicitly says "done", "complete", or "satisfied"
2. All categories covered comprehensively AND
3. No more gaps detected in plan AND
4. All open questions have been answered

If not complete, return to Phase 3 with adaptive depth.

### Phase 7: Open Questions Review (before completion)

Re-ask all deferred questions for final validation. Remove resolved items from the Open Questions section.

## Open Questions Tracking

Deferred questions are tracked as a plain text section appended to the plan file:

```markdown
## Open Questions

- [ ] [Technical] How to handle token refresh race conditions? — *deferred: discuss with the team*
- [ ] [Domain] What authorization rules apply to admin users? — *deferred: leave question for Egemen*
- [ ] [UX] What happens when session expires mid-form-fill? — *deferred: I don't know*
- [x] [Security] Where are credentials stored? — *answered round 3: Vault with rotation*
```

**Tracking rules:**
1. After each round, append new deferred items to Open Questions
2. When a deferred item gets answered in a later round, mark it `[x]` with the answer
3. If no Open Questions section exists, create it at the end of the plan file
4. On completion, remove fully-resolved items (keep only genuinely open ones)

## Adaptive Depth Strategy

**Round 1: Surface Scan**
- Identify sections with decisions but no rationale
- Find unvalidated assumptions
- Detect missing error handling
- Flag vague requirements

**Round 2+: Adaptive Deepening**
- Detailed answers: Continue at current depth
- Frequent deferrals: Pivot to different category
- Terse answers: Ask Socratic follow-ups
- Gaps filled: Move to next category

**Category Progression:**
1. Technical (Stack -> Arch -> Impl)
2. Domain (Rules -> Workflows -> Data)
3. UX (Happy -> Edge -> Error -> A11y)
4. Non-functional (Security -> Perf -> Scale)
5. Trade-offs (Alternatives -> Rationale -> Risks)

## Output

Original plan file updated with:
- Validated decisions woven naturally into narrative
- Technical rationale for choices
- Domain rules explicitly documented
- UX flows expanded with edge case handling
- Non-functional considerations integrated
- Trade-off analysis for major decisions
- Open Questions section for unresolved items

No separate interview report — plan refinement is self-documenting.

## When to Use

- You have a plan that feels "complete" but want rigorous validation
- You need to ensure no assumptions are left unquestioned
- You want to document decision rationale comprehensively
- You're about to implement and want confidence in the approach
- You want the team to see what questions remain open
